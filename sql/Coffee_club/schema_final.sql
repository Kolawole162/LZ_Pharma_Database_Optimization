1. Creating Primary_keys

ALTER TABLE customers
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_customers PRIMARY KEY (customer_id);

ALTER TABLE offers
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_offers PRIMARY KEY (offer_id);

--Events has no natural PK so we generate one
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN event_id BIGSERIAL;
ALTER TABLE events ADD CONSTRAINT pk_events PRIMARY KEY (event_id);

--offer_channels: composite PK on  (offer_id, channel)
ALTER TABLE offer_channels
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_offer_channels PRIMARY KEY (offer_id, channels);

2. Creating Foreign_Keys

ALTER TABLE events
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_events_customer
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE

ALTER TABLE events
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_events_offer
FOREIGN KEY (offer_id) REFERENCES offers(offer_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE offer_channels
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_offerchannels_offer 
FOREIGN KEY (offer_id) REFERENCES offers(offer_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE

ALTER TABLE events
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_events_offer 
FOREIGN KEY (offer_id) REFERENCES offers(offer_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL

3. --High Traffic_Columns (Tree Indexex)

CREATE INDEX idx_events_customer_id ON events(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_offer_id    ON events(offer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_event       ON events(event);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_time        ON events(time);

-- customer segmentation columns (common in analytics queries)
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_income   ON customers(income);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_age      ON customers(age);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_became_member ON customers(became_member_on);

-- offer lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_offers_offer_type  ON offers(offer_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_offerchannels_offer_id ON offer_channels(offer_id);


-- SOLUTION TO TASK 2
--Converting raw time integers into days/hours

-- Step 1: Add the two new columns
ALTER TABLE events
ADD COLUMN day          SMALLINT,
ADD COLUMN hour_of_day  SMALLINT;

-- Step 2: Populate them from the raw time column
-- time is hours elapsed since start of the 30-day period
-- day        = which day of the 30-day period (0–29)
-- hour_of_day = what hour within that day   (0–23)
UPDATE events
SET 
    day          = (time / 24),   -- integer division: 0–29
    hour_of_day  = (time % 24);   -- remainder: 0, 6, 12, or 18

-- Step 3: Verify the transformation
SELECT 
    time,
    day,
    hour_of_day
FROM events
ORDER BY time;


--Handling time delta/ (interval mapping)

-- Add a proper interval column
ALTER TABLE events
ADD COLUMN time_interval INTERVAL

-- Convert raw hours integer → PostgreSQL INTERVAL
UPDATE events
SET time_interval = (time || ' hours')::INTERVAL;

-- Verify: this lets you do real time arithmetic
SELECT 
    time,
    time_interval,
    TIMESTAMP '2024-01-01' + time_interval AS actual_timestamp
FROM events;

--Adding constraints to new columns

-- Ensure day is always 0–29
ALTER TABLE events
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_day 
CHECK (day BETWEEN 0 AND 29);

-- Ensure hour_of_day is always 0–23
ALTER TABLE events
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_hour 
CHECK (hour_of_day BETWEEN 0 AND 23);
